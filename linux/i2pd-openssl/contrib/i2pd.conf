## Configuration file for a typical i2pd user
## See https://i2pd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-guide/configuration/
## for more options you can use in this file.

## Lines that begin with "## " try to explain what's going on. Lines
## that begin with just "#" are disabled commands: you can enable them
## by removing the "#" symbol.

## Tunnels config file
## Default: ~/.i2pd/tunnels.conf or /var/lib/i2pd/tunnels.conf
# tunconf = /var/lib/i2pd/tunnels.conf

## Tunnels config files path
## Use that path to store separated tunnels in different config files.

## Logging configuration section
## By default logs go to stdout with level 'info' and higher
## For Windows OS by default logs go to file with level 'warn' and higher
##
## Logs destination (valid values: stdout, file, syslog)
##  * stdout - print log entries to stdout
##  * file - log entries to a file
##  * syslog - use syslog, see man 3 syslog
# log = file
## Path to logfile (default - autodetect)
# logfile = /var/log/i2pd/i2pd.log
## Log messages above this level (debug, info, *warn, error, critical, none)
## If you set it to none, logging will be disabled
# loglevel = warn

## share more bandwidth without floodfill mode, uncomment that line and adjust
## value to your possibilities
# bandwidth = L
